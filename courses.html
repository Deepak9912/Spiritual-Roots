            <h2>Cognitive Behavioural Psychotherapy (CBT)</h2>
            <p>Cognitive-Behavioural Psychotherapy (CBT) is a present-focused talking therapy supported by many years
                evidence-based clinical research. In CBT, we look at our problems by learning about the relationship
                between how we think about ourselves, our relationships with others and the world around us, and how
                this affects our emotions and what we do in response. It is focused on the here and now, to help you
                find ways to cope with worry, anxiety and depression in your daily life.</p>
            <p>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy has clinically proven treatments for the following difficulties :</p>

                <p>“When I first came across CBT I was in a constant state of anxiety and could not relax and settle
                    myself. Everything was difficult. Even small tasks caused me stress. I started CBT with Shirine and
                    I cannot believe the difference it made and is still making to my life. CBT has given me the ability
                    to help heal and look after myself” Dave</p>

            <h2>Mindfulness</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Mindfulness is a way to bring health, wellbeing and vibrancy to our lives. Through mindfulness we are
                wholeheartedly present and fully alive in each moment. It is a practical skill which involves
                consciously
                slowing down and being present in each moment, allowing us to accept our experience without judgement.
                It is
                a process whereby we deliberately pay attention to our thoughts, emotions or physical sensations in a
                way
                that is non-judgemental and supportive to our wellbeing.</p>
            <p>Mindfulness means coming home to an awareness of our senses (sight, sound, taste, touch). We find ways to
                anchor into the present moment through our breath, body, physical sensations, or by noticing the world
                around us and what we are doing right now. This is the key to present moment awareness.</p>

                <p>“Thanks so much Spiritual-connection. It has been an amazing 8 weeks. I am more relaxed and calm and
                    better equipped to deal my busy life as a mom, manager and wife. My children now have my full
                    attention
                    in the evenings, we have much more fun at home now. I am able to switch gears between work and
                    home.”
