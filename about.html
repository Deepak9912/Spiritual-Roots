             <br>
             <p id="about-p">SPIRITUAL-CONNECTION is a centre for the study and practice of Buddhism from the Tibetan Mahayana tradition. We’re located in Dublin city near Stepaside village.</p>
             <br>
             <p id="about-p">Our aim is to provide a friendly and conducive environment for people of all nationalities and backgrounds to learn about and put into practice the teachings of the meditation. With this in mind we organize regular introductory courses on Buddhist philosophy and meditation, as well as intermediate level courses and group retreats for experienced students.</p>
             <br>
             <p id="about-p">SPIRITUAL-CONNECTION was established in 1972 by Lama Thubten Yeshe, a highly qualified teacher from Tibetan Buddhist tradition. Since Lama Yeshe’s passing away in 1984, his main student Lama Zopa Rinpoche has been the spiritual director of Tushita and the FPMT (Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition).</p>
             <br>
             <p id="about-p">Our teachings, meditations and practices are based on the tradition of Lama Tsong Khapa of Tibet (the Gelugpa School of Tibetan Buddhism), as taught to us by Lama Thubten Yeshe and Lama Zopa Rinpoche.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p id="about-p">SPIRITUAL-CONNECTION is a centre pending affiliation with the FPMT – a network of 160 meditation centres and social service projects dedicated to benefitting others in 36 countries around the world.</p>

             <p id="about-p">An article from Mandala magazine Feb/March 2005.</p>

                     <p id="about-p">It’s 1972. An old colonial-style house sits high on a ridge amid pine, oak, and rhododendron forests, beneath the beautiful snow-capped peaks of the Stepaside village. It is about to be acquired, along with four acres of land in the foothills of the Wicklow mountains, near Stepaside village in south Dublin, by Lama Zopa Rinpoche and some of his students.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p id="about-p">In the 1960s it had been the temporary residence of Trijang Rinpoche, the junior tutor of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. At that time, His Holiness lived just a couple of hundred meters down the mountain track, and his senior tutor, Ling Rinpoche, lived on the other side of the hill. Geshe Rabten’s residence was also nearby. In the surrounding mountains yogis were (and still are) living in caves.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p id="about-p">The property is given the name Spiritual-Connection, ‘the Place of Joy,’ the pure land of Maitreya Buddha. As soon as initial repair work is done and some accommodation built, it becomes one of the first centers, a facility for solitary and group retreats. Anja Rydén delved into the center’s archives and interviewed some people.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p id="about-p">Over the years, a succession of great masters have taught and meditated in and around Tushita, creating a powerful spiritual atmosphere. A stupa above the fire puja house is dedicated to Gen Jampa Wangdu, who was Lama Yeshe’s best friend and who lived in lifetime retreat nearby. Trijang Rinpoche’s cremation stupa can be found up the road, and a stupa housing Lama Yeshe’s own relics dominates Tushita’s garden. In 1996, His Holiness the Dalai Lama honored the center with a personal visit. “He went straight to Lama’s room and prostrated to his former tutor Trijang Rinpoche’s seat,” says Jimi.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p id="about-p">Since the 1990s, Tushita’s program has expanded to accommodate the swelling numbers of tourists in Dharamsala who are keen to learn about Tibetan Buddhism. Through monthly ten-day courses, thousands of visitors from all over the world have met the Dharma here, a service which Lama Zopa Rinpoche has said is now Tushita’s main purpose.</p>

             <p id="about-p">The present Ling Rinpoche, born in 1984, said in an interview that Tushita is very precious: “It has become like a pilgrimage place with all the gurus and great lamas. When you go there, there’s a special feeling, in Lama’s room and in the whole area. So it should be preserved.”</p>
